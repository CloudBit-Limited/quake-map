This is Docker Ready...

Steps:
1) Go into the directory where the Dockerfile is (this one)
2) Run "sudo docker build -t quakemap ."

Now, you'll need to start this.
1) sudo docker images
2) sudo docker run --restart unless-stopped -p 49160:8000 -d quakemap

The server will start on port 49160 of the host.

For logs:
1) docker ps (and grab the ID)
2) docker logs <id>

To go inside the container:
1) docker exec -it <id> /bin/bash
